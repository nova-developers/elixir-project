# Elixir-project

###March 8, 2015

Reading from the book, I first have found out how to compile and run Elixir, which 
is talked about at location 513

> .ex or .exs are extensions for Elixir files. Files ending in .ex are intended
> to be compiled into bytecodes and then run, whereas those ending in .exs are
> more like programs in scripting languages - they are effectively interpreted
> at the souce level.
